Description: Latent variable modeling with Principal Component Analysis
        (PCA) and Partial Least Squares (PLS) are powerful methods for
        visualization, regression, classification, and feature
        selection of omics data where the number of variables exceeds
        the number of samples and with multicollinearity among
        variables. Orthogonal Partial Least Squares (OPLS) enables to
        separately model the variation correlated (predictive) to the
        factor of interest and the uncorrelated (orthogonal) variation.
        While performing similarly to PLS, OPLS facilitates
        interpretation. Successful applications of these chemometrics
        techniques include spectroscopic data such as Raman
        spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass
        spectrometry (MS) in metabolomics and proteomics, but also
        transcriptomics data. In addition to scores, loadings and
        weights plots, the package provides metrics and graphics to
        determine the optimal number of components (e.g. with the R2
        and Q2 coefficients), check the validity of the model by
        permutation testing, detect outliers, and perform feature
        selection (e.g. with Variable Importance in Projection or
        regression coefficients). The package can be accessed via a
        user interface on the Workflow4Metabolomics.org online resource
        for computational metabolomics (built upon the Galaxy
        environment).
